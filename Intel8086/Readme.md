# Intel 8086 Final Project

### This project consists in pass by terminal argument a file to find an user string input. The program shows the previous and the next word and ask the user if he wants to continue. All made in intel 8086 assembly for DOS and assembled with MASM.

To run the code, you will need to goto DOSbox directory, run DOSBox.exe and type `mount C C:\[This Repository path]`, next `C:` and then do `.\FIND [name of the .txt file]`

The code *only works with ASCII characters*, without special characters like ã, á, à, ç and others.
