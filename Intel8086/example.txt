Professor Julio Elias Normey Rico from the Department and Graduate Program in Automation and Systems Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) has been awarded the Theory and Applications in Automatic Control Prize by the Brazilian Society of Automation (SBA). The award recognizes notable contributions to engineering, science, and technology in control systems and automation in Brazil, as well as significant technical contributions and long-term services rendered to the SBA.

The professor will receive the award during the XXV Brazilian Congress of Automation (CBA), which will take place from October 15 to 18 at the Windsor Convention Center in Rio de Janeiro. The congress is organized by the SBA, with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) overseeing the organization and supported by the Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (Cefet/RJ) and UFSC.

According to the SBA, the following criteria are considered in the evaluation and judgment of researchers and professionals: the seminal nature of the contribution, singular achievement, practical impact, breadth and depth of contributions, historical precedence, and the quality of the nomination. With over 30 years of teaching and academic research at UFSC, Professor Normey Rico has developed theories and practices for process control with delays and their applications in renewable energy systems within the automation and systems field.
